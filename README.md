Coursework 2 for Programming Fundamentals (SET07109) Edinburgh Napier University

The aim of this coursework was to create a command line program that can take a C file as an input and print out and store the indentifiers (loops, variables, etc.). Part A of the coursework was to write the code for this and Part B was to implement a binary serch tree to more efficiently store the data.
